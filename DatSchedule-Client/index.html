                Time management is a tricky thing.  It's difficult to have to fit everything you need to do in a day and not have anything to carry over.        
            </p>
            <p>
                Now you're going to get the chance to manage someone else's daily life, scheduling everything from the <span class="boring">boring</span> work stuff to the things we <span class="interesting">actually</span> want to do.

                You'll see a timeline for the day along the bottom.  Fill it up by choosing activities from the left.  You can see the effects of your choices in the charts on the right.
